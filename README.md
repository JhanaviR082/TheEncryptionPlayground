# The Encryption Playground

The Encryption Playground is an interactive, beginner-friendly platform designed to explore five of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms — DES, AES, RSA, SHA-256, and Diffie–Hellman. It presents each algorithm through cleanly designed cards, simple explanations, and a functional DES encryption demo to help learners understand how data security works in the real world.

## 🚀 Features
Interactive cards showcasing major encryption algorithms
Clear and concise explanations suitable for CNS beginners
Live DES encryption demonstration using JavaScript
Lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing interface
Ideal for academic learning, CNS labs, and project presentations
